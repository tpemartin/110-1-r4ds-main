```{r}
JohnsFamily <-
  list(
    name = "John", 
    age = 35,
    spouse = list(
      name = "Mary", 
      age = 32),
    children = list(
      list(
        name = "Bill", 
        age = 5),
      list(
        name = "Jane", 
        age = 3)
    )
  )
```

```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy3 <- JohnsFamily
JohnsFamilyCopy3$children[3] <-
```

To add value to `JohnsFamilyCopy3$children[3]` with proper structure, you better check the current structure of existing child. For example, 
```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy3$children[2] -> child2
str(child2) # show you the structure 
```

It is like the following list:

  1.  
    * name: "John"  
    * age: 3
 
```{r}
list(
  list(
    name="John",
    age=3
    )
)
```

Therefore, the value of child 3 should follow that same structure:
```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy3$children[2] <-
  list(
    list(
      name="Lisa",
      age=0
      )
  )
```
