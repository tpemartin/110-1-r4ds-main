One way:
```{r}
p <- table(johnDoe$data$發現月)
pick_max <- p == max(p)
p[pick_max]
```

Or look for a different max function:
```{r}
p <- table(johnDoe$data$發現月)
whichIsMax <- which.max(p)
p[whichIsMax]
```

I think you use `pick` name too freely. You should stick with my lecture note. `pickXXX` is for comparison that returns logical values. `whichYYY` is for comparison that has position indices as values. 

Object name you create is very important for your brain to think. An object name with meaning will enhance your brain's algorithm process. For example, 
```{r}
p <- table(johnDoe$data$發現月)
```
p is not a good name. Whenever you need to continue to use p, your brain has to keep a place to remember what p is about. 
```{r}
tb_month <- table(johnDoe$data$發現月)
```
or similiar to that is a better one. When you need to use tb_month, once you type it you know what it is. It will not block your thinking.
